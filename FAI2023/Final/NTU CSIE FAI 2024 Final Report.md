# NTU CSIE FAI 2024 Final Report

## Methods explored

Due to the challenges in obtaining or generating training data, training a supervised model for my poker agent was not an ideal option. Instead, I employed rule-based conditions to determine the agent's actions. The methods I explored are as follows:

1. <b>All In Every Time (AIET)</b>
   My initial intuition was that many players would fold if they lacked confidence in their hole cards or faced aggressive raises. The AIET strategy involves the agent going all-in every time it is their turn. Experimental results showed that, despite its simplicity, this strategy performed tolerably well.

2. <b>Winning Rate Driven (WRD)</b>

   The WRD series of strategies base the agent's actions on its estimated winning rate.

   <b>Version 1 (V1):Â </b>In this simple strategy, if the winning rate is above a higher threshold (0.5), the agent raises an amount proportional to its winning rate. If the winning rate is above a lower threshold (0.3), it calls. Otherwise, it folds. Experimental results indicated that this strategy was slightly less effective than AIET.

   <b>Version 2 (V2):</b> An improved version of V1, V2 introduced two new features: if the agent had a sufficient stack to win the game, it would fold to conserve its lead. Additionally, in the late game (last five rounds), the agent would significantly increase its raise amount to turn the tables. This version showed considerable improvement over V1.

   <b>Version 3 (V3):</b> The ultimate version of WRD, V3, introduced several new features and removed conflicting ones. The most crucial feature was that if an action (call/fold) would lead to losing the game, the agent would go all-in as a last resort. This feature leveraged the fear of many opponents who fold against an all-in bet. Additionally, if the winning rate exceeded 97%, the agent would seize the opportunity to go all-in. V3's structure allowed multiple criteria to decide whether to all-in, raise, call, or fold, resulting in significant performance improvements over V2.

<b> Wednesday (6/12) morning, I found that all my code on the WorkStation2 were deleted by VS Code with no apparent reason (I didn't do anything), so I can't provide the exact parameters and criteria for the above agents, the only thing I have is the result of the experiments.</b>

3. <b>Winning Rate Driven with Risk Aversion (WRD-RA)</b>
   WRD-RA is a variant of WRD inspired by the observation that my agents often lost even with a winning rate higher than 97% (which will go all-in). It would only go all-in if folding would result in losing the game or if the winning rate was high, but calling and losing that round would also mean losing the game. Another key feature was that WRD-RA would avoid raising excessively or allowing the pot size to become too large, thereby inducing opponents to call and lose more stacks. These strategies significantly improved performance, achieving over a 90% winning rate against baselines 0-3, and more than 50% against baselines 4-7.
   The drop in winning rate from baselines 0-3 to baselines 4-7 was due to the latter's design, which included an all-in strategy at the "preflop" stage when facing imminent loss. This created a critical issue: at that point, the agent had only two options, fold or leave it to chance. If WRD-RA left it to chance, the final outcome had little correlation with previous successes, making much of the effort in vain.
   To address this, WRD-RA introduced a new feature: <b>leverage</b>. The philosophy behind leverage is that when WRD-RA is going  to win, baselines 4-7 would frequently go all-in regardless of their hole cards. When facing an all-in, WRD-RA would fold without sufficient confidence, despite often having better hole cards. The leverage feature lowers the thresholds for calling and all-in when WRD-RA is on the verge of winning, aiming to catch the opponent's bluffs and secure a victory.
   The experimental results showed that with <b>full leverage (WRD-RA-FL)</b>, the winning rate against baseline 7 increased by over 10%, while the winning rates against baselines 4-6 slightly decreased. This decrease may be due to the instability introduced by leaving more decisions to chance. To mitigate this, I developed a third version: <b>WRD-RA with Half Leverage (WRD-RA-HL)</b>. In this version, leverage is activated only when the agent is on the verge of winning and it is the late game, as opponents are more likely to make irrational decisions under pressure. This adjustment aims to catch opponents' bluffs while preserving the agent's stability. With half leverage, the winning rate against baselines 4-7 significantly increased, indicating that this may be a good strategy.

## Experimental Results

<b>The table below shows the result of each method combatting against baselines.</b>

The table below shows the results of each method when competing against the baselines. The gaming configuration of the experiments was the same as the default (max_round=20, initial_stack=1000, small_blind_amount=5).

For AIET and WRD series, I ran the game with each baseline 25 times. For the WRD-RA series, I ran the game 100 times to approximate real-world probability distributions. The results are shown in the table below.

## Submitted Method

The method I choose to submit is WRD-RA-HL, and I'll illustrate it below.

### When making decisions:

The stage of the round influences the criteria, but the underlying philosophy remains consistent.

WRD-RA-HL controls the pot size, keeping it under a certain amount during the early stages. This conservative approach may involve calling even with a strong hand, as the winning rate is often overestimated early on. Raising large amounts in the early stages increases the risk of losing the game. Conversely, in the late stages, the winning rate better approximates real-world probability distributions. Therefore, raising larger amounts when the winning rate is high is a more appealing strategy.

Additionally, in the late stages, if opponents have not raised (called 0 stack), it may indicate their lack of confidence in winning the round. In such cases, WRD-RA-HL will raise if it has sufficient confidence. This tactic forces opponents to either fold or lose more stacks, leading to a significant improvement in performance.

The leverage feature lowers the threshold for taking aggressive actions when the agent is on the verge of winning and in the late game, where opponents are more likely to make irrational decisions.

### Action Execution

- **Raise:** If the decision is to raise, the agent will either raise or call if raising is not a valid action.
- **Call:** If the decision is to call, the agent checks whether calling and losing the round would result in losing the entire game. If not, it will call. If calling would lead to losing the game, the agent will go all-in if folding would result in a loss or if the winning rate is higher than 0.8. Otherwise, it will fold.
- **Fold:** If the decision is to fold, the agent checks whether folding would lead to losing the game. If so, it will go all-in; otherwise, it will fold.
