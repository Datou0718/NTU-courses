{"prompt": "Task:\nYou are a math teacher, solve the following math question for students step by step.\nThis is very important for the students and please solve the problem correctly.\nI'll give you two examples, please learn from them and answer the question.\n\nExample 1:\nQuestion: Shawn has five toys.For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad.How many toys doe she have now?\nAnswer: Shawn initially has 5 toys.\nChristmas gifts:\n* Mom: 2 toys\n* Dad: 2 toys\nTotal number of toys received as gifts: 2 toys (from Mom) + 2 toys (from Dad) = 4 toys\nShawn's total number of toys: 5 toys (initial) + 4 toys (gifts) = 9 toys\nTherefore, Shawn has 9 toys now.\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A farm has chickens and cows. If there are a total of 21 heads and 60 legs, how many cows are on the farm?\nAnswer: Let's solve this step-by-step:\n1. Define Variables:\n    * Let C be the number of cows on the farm.\n    * Let X be the number of chickens on the farm.\n2. Translate Information into Equations:\n    * We know there are 21 heads total: C + X = 21 (each cow and chicken has one head).\n    * We know there are 60 legs total: 4C + 2X = 60 (cows have 4 legs each, chickens have 2 legs each).\n3. Solve the System of Equations:\n    * We can't directly solve for C with one equation. However, we can use the fact that chickens have 2 fewer legs than cows (4 legs - 2 legs = 2 legs).\n    * We can rewrite the second equation to isolate X: 2X = 60 - 4C\n    * X = 30 - 2C\n4. Substitute and Solve for C:\n    * Now, substitute this expression for X in the first equation: C + (30 - 2C) = 21\n    * Simplify: C - 2C + 30 = 21\n    * Combine like terms: -C + 30 = 21\n    * Isolate C: -C = 21 - 30\n    * Solve for C: C = 9\nTherefore, there are 9 cows on the farm.\nVerification:\n* With 9 cows, there are 9 heads (from cows).\n* We can now calculate the number of chickens using X = 30 - 2C = 30 - (2 * 9) = 12 chickens.\n* The total heads from chickens and cows is 9 (cows) + 12 (chickens) = 21 heads (matches the given information).\n* The total legs from chickens and cows is 9 (cows) * 4 (legs/cow) + 12 (chickens) * 2 (legs/chicken) = 36 + 24 = 60 legs (matches the given information).\n\nNow, answer the following question.\nUse easy way to solve it and check whether the answer you generated is correct.\nThis is very important for my life!\nQuestion: {{question}}\nAnswer: "}
